**Add online booking to your Wordpress © site ... for FREE !**

Want to connect with your visitors?  TalkHours is a tool that gives you the power to add online booking to your Wordpress © site.  Sign-up and installation takes less than 5 minutes and the service is FREE !  TalkHours adds an elegant intuitive card or button that displays your schedule onto your site making it easy for clients to book your time.  

Businesses love TalkHours.  It is currently used by lawyers, accountants, financial planners and scores of other service professionals.  Adding TalkHours helps businesses: 

1. Convert more customers

    Testing has shown the TalkHours button increased site conversion rates from 1% to 5% over just having a phone number on your site. For sites with a marketing budget this can be the difference between $500 per lead versus $100

2. Save time and money

   People and businesses that don't employ a receptionist spend time scheduling and coordinating with customers that they could use being productive. Big firms hire pricey phone banks to do this. By contrast TalkHours is free and takes less than a minute to set up
